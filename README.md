# ESP8266-MQTT-PIR
Arduino sketch for ESP8266 sends PIR motion events to MQTT

This code is designed to efficiently read input from a PIR sensor and send a message to a MQTT broker. I built it based on a NodeMCU but it should work on any ESP8266 variant with basic changes to pin numbers. If you have any awesome improvements please share!
